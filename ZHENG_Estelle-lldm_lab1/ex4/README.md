# Exercice 4

## Disclaimer
Every code has been written using the documentation website of syscalls [man7.org](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/index.html). 

## What was used

6 syscalls were used: `open()`, `write()`, `read()`, `close()`, `mmap()`, `munmap()`.

All of the information about how a system call works is written as a comment in this actual code.

## Running the code
Open the terminal and just run this code normally.

```bash
gcc -o ex4 ex4.c
./ex4
```

A `hello.txt` was created after sucessfully compiling this code. 
However, to open it after running the code, I had to modify the authorization.
