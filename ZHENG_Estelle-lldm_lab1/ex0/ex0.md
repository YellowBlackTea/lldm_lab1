# Exercice 0

## Software
The lab has been done on **macOS Mojave 10.14.6**.

Every codes were written and tested on **Visual Studio Code 1.62.2**.

## Exceptions
*Exercice 1 - strace* was done on a Linux machine running **Ubuntu 20.4**.

*Exercice 3 - Google Pub/Sub* was completely done and worked on my **Macbook**. However as a way to check if everything was running properly without the Google account active, I used **Unbuntu 20.4**. It worked.

## How to run this lab
There is a `README` file for almost each exercice explaining how the code should work and how it should be run.
